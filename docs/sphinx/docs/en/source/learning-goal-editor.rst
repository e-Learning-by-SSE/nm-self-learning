Learning Goal Editor
====================

The **Learning Goal Editor** is available to students if the *Learning Diary* has been enabled in the settings. The profile then displays the tile **"My Learning Goals"**, which leads to the editor.

Views
---------

The Learning Goal Editor offers two different views for organizing learning goals. The tab **"In Progress"** shows all active goals that are not yet fully completed. The tab **"Completed"** displays all fully completed coarse and fine goals in a separate overview.

Creating Learning Goals
-----------------------

Clicking the **Create Learning Goal** button opens an input field for describing the new learning goal.

Coarse and Fine Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Learning goals are divided into coarse and fine goals:

- **Coarse Goal**: overarching goal that can contain several more specific fine goals. 
- **Fine Goal**: specific, detailed goal that is assigned to a coarse goal.

When creating a learning goal, an optional parent goal can be selected from a dropdown menu. This creates a new fine goal under the parent goal. If no parent goal is selected, an independent coarse goal is created.

Editing Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each learning goal has three different editing statuses, which are indicated by different colors:

- **Not Edited**: gray
- **In Progress**: orange
- **Completed**: green

The status changes by clicking on the status indicator, which cycles through the three statuses.

Rules for Coarse and Fine Goals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a coarse goal contains **at least one fine goal**, its status is also determined by the status of the fine goals:

  - If a fine goal is *In Progress*, the coarse goal also receives the status *In Progress*
  - If all fine goals are *Completed*, the coarse goal initially remains *In Progress*
  - Coarse goals can only be marked as *Completed* after manual confirmation

A fine goal marked as *Completed* can be reset to *Not Edited* by clicking again. This may also change the status of the parent coarse goal.

Additional Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following functions are available for managing learning goals:

- **Plus-Button**: adds a new fine goal to an existing coarse goal
- **Pencil-Button**: edit the description of a goal
- **Delete-Button**: remove a goal from the list
